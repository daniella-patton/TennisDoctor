# Motivation
Female professional tennis players face a grueling and time consuming schedule. Their are over 36-weeks of WTA tournaments scheduled for 2020 alone. Further, their is only ~6 weeks of off-season in a given year. Given the gureling tennis season, injuries are both common and frequent amongst the top 200 players. This project predicts the risk of future injury (i.e., in the next three months) of tennis players based off of previous match and injury, and rnaking history.  

This reposiitory contains all of the base code for this project.
